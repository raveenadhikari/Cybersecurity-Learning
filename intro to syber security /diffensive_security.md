## 🔹 Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **SOC** is a team that monitors networks & systems for malicious events.  

### Key Focus Areas:
- 🛠️ **Vulnerabilities** → Apply patches/updates, apply mitigations.  
- 📜 **Policy Violations** → Example: uploading confidential data to public storage.  
- 🔑 **Unauthorized Activity** → Detect stolen credentials & stop intrusions.  
- 🌐 **Network Intrusions** → Detect & block attacks like phishing clicks or server exploits.  

### ✨ Threat Intelligence
- **Goal:** Build a *threat-informed defense*.  
- **What it does:**  
  - Collects 📊 data → (logs, forums, public sources).  
  - Processes & analyzes data 🔎 → Identify attackers’ motives, tactics & techniques.  
  - Produces ✅ actionable steps for defense.  
- **Examples of adversaries:**  
  - Nation-state cyber armies 🏴  
  - Ransomware groups 💰

## 🔹 Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

### 🧪 Digital Forensics
Investigating digital evidence to analyze attacks, espionage, or data theft.  

- 💾 **File System** → Deleted files, hidden traces.  
- 🧠 **System Memory** → Malicious programs running in RAM.  
- 📂 **System Logs** → Application, security, and event logs.  
- 🌐 **Network Logs** → Monitor suspicious packets & attack evidence.

### 🚨 Incident Response (IR)

> **Goal:** Minimize damage & recover quickly from cyber attacks.  

**4 Phases of IR:**  
1. 🛡️ **Preparation** → Team training, preventive measures.  
2. 🔍 **Detection & Analysis** → Spot incidents, assess severity.  
3. 🔒 **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** → Stop spread, remove threat, restore systems.  
4. 📖 **Post-Incident** → Reports & lessons learned.

### 🦠 Malware Analysis

**Malware = Malicious Software** (programs, files, documents).  

- 🦠 **Virus** → Attaches to files/programs, spreads & damages systems.  
- 🐴 **Trojan Horse** → Appears useful but hides malicious intent (e.g., fake media player).  
- 💸 **Ransomware** → Encrypts files & demands payment for decryption.  

---

## 🎯 Quick Recap
- SOC → Detects & responds to threats.  
- Threat Intelligence → Know the **who** and **how** behind attacks.  
- DFIR → Collects evidence & responds methodically.  
- Malware Analysis → Understands and mitigates malicious software.
